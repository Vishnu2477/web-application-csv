# web-application-csv
Grootan Coding Assignment
Create a web application with an option to upload a CSV file of 1 lakh or more records, 
where the application should read the records, process it, and push to the database table.
The CSV file will have a header row that denotes the database table column names and rows 
which represent the values of the database table.
After the upload of the CSV file, only the database table should be created dynamically 
based on the header names of the CSV file and the insert of row values should be carried 
out later.
In case if there are any header named as “password”, the value should be encrypted 
dynamically and saved in the database.

3. Showing proper message in case of failures
4. Showing of no of records processed or failed
5. Efficient usage of database calls
6. Well documented
7. Maintainable code (In case used any architectural patterns, will be an added 
advantage
